This database supports the Upvoit Field Service Management platform. It organizes information around Companies, their Clients, the Jobs performed for those clients, and the Users (technicians, admins) who perform the work.

Key processes tracked include:
- Scheduling: Handled by `JobSchedule` table, which store information about one-off and recurring job schedules, and `JobScheduleUsers` table, which stores information about users associated with job schedules. These tables are linked to `Job` and `Company` tables.
- Work Logging: Technician hours are tracked in `Timesheet`.
- Billing: Managed through `Quotation`, `Invoice`, and `Payment` tables.
- Payroll: Processed using `Payroll` and related tables (`Payroll_Expense`, `Payroll_LoggedHours`, `Payroll_OtherExpense`) based on `Timesheet` data.
- Supporting Data: Includes checklists (`checkList`, `checkListDetails`), documents (`companyDocument`), expenses (`expenses`), client properties (`clientProperty`), and various configurations (e.g., `JobType`, `Services`, `Tax`).

CRITICAL TABLE RELATIONSHIPS TO REMEMBER:
- `Users` table = Contains all employee/technician information
- `Clients` table = Contains all customer information
- `clientProperty` table = Contains client addresses and property details

IMPORTANT BUSINESS LOGIC:
- Total expense amounts are derived from the 'Total' column in the 'Expenses' table.
- For job-specific expenses, join with the 'Job' table; otherwise, no join is required for general expense totals.
- Payment information is found in the 'PaidAmount' column, which represents the total amount paid.
- Revenue is calculated using the 'NetTotal' column from the 'Invoice' table, with no additional joins needed.
- Within the 'Job' table:
  - 'ExpenseTotal' stores the total expense amount for that specific job.
  - 'TotalPrice' stores the total price for that specific job.
